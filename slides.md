# Slidev

GitHub template demonstration

Use the <kbd>➡️ right arrow</kbd> or the <kbd>space bar</kbd> of your keyboard to navigate to next slide.

---

# How to use this template

First push the button `Use this template`

<img src="/images/demo.gif" class="h-95 rounded shadow" />

---

# How to use this template

Then activate GitHub Pages

<img src="/images/demo2.gif" class="h-95 rounded shadow" />

---

# How to use this template

Finally check the website

Navigate to :

```
https://<your github user name>.github.io/<your repository name>
```

---

# Now you can make your first commit

Edit the file `slides.md` in your new repository.

The Slidev syntax is easy to learn, especially if you already know Markdown.

Check the official [Slidev Demo](https://demo.sli.dev/starter/).

And the [Markdown Syntax guide](https://sli.dev/guide/syntax.html).

# Code blocks

Directly use code blocks for highlighting

```ts
console.log('Hello, World!')
```

To highlight specific lines, simply add line numbers within bracket {}. Line numbers start counting from 1.

```go {5-7}
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	fmt.Println("Hello, 世界")
}
```

To change the highlight in multiple steps, you can use | to separate them. For example `{1|2|3}`

```java {1|2|3}
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World");
    }
}
```

---

# Monaco Editor

Whenever you want to do some modification in the presentation

Simply add {monaco} after the language id — it turns the block into a fully-featured Monaco editor!

```ts {monaco}
console.log('HelloWorld')
```

---

# Embedded Styles

You can use `<style>` tag in your Markdown directly to override styles for the current slide.

Text on the current slide will be red.

```html
<style>
p {
  color: red
}
</style>
```

<style>
p {
  color: red
}
</style>

Next slide is not affected

---

# Static assets

Just like you would do in markdown, you can use images pointing to a remote or local url.

Put them into the public folder and reference them with leading slash.

![Go Logo](/images/2754575_man_avatar_male_icon.png)

If you want to apply custom sizes or styles, you can convert them to the `<img>` tag

```html
<img src="/images/Go-Logo_Aqua.png" class="h-40 rounded shadow" />
```

<img src="/images/Go-Logo_Aqua.png" class="h-40 rounded shadow" />

# Notes

<!-- This is NOT a note because it precedes the content of the slide -->

You can also take notes for each slide.

They will show up in [Presenter Mode](/presenter) for you to reference during presentations.

<!--
This is a note

# Icons

Slidev allows you to have the accessing to almost all the popular open-source iconsets directly in your markdown.

The naming follows Iconify's conversion {collection-name}-{icon-name}.

- `<mdi-account-circle />` : <mdi-account-circle /> from [Material Design Icons](https://github.com/Templarian/MaterialDesign)
- `<carbon-badge />` : <carbon-badge /> from [Carbon](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/tree/main/packages/icons)
- `<uim-rocket />` : <uim-rocket /> from [Unicons Monochrome](https://github.com/Iconscout/unicons)
- `<twemoji-cat-with-tears-of-joy />` : <twemoji-cat-with-tears-of-joy /> from [Twemoji](https://github.com/twitter/twemoji)
- `<logos-vue />` : <logos-vue /> from [SVG Logos](https://github.com/gilbarbara/logos)
- and much more ...

You can style the icons just like other HTML elements. For example:

<uim-rocket class="text-3xl text-orange-400 animate-ping" />
